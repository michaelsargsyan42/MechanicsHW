I have applied the algorithm on the file lse-f-91.stu both without associator and with associator.

First of all, let’s discuss the case without the autoassociator.

File lse-f-91.stu contained 381 courses, and when I loaded the courses at first, there were a lot of conflicts. And there were a lot of red lines.

Shift 1: conflicts are slowly becoming resolved, but after few steps, you do not see much progress.

Shift: 15: If you take a bigger shift, first step solves many conflicts, and if you do 2-3 more steps, you will see that most of the conflicts are resolved. 
SWITCH TO AUTOASSOCIATOR 

Using autoassociator, however, it initially starts all red, however, after hitting start, almost all the conflicts are resolved.

With Shift = 1: after hitting step, almost all conflicts are resolved. However, not all of them. If you press step again, all the conflicts will be resolved.

With Shift = 15: changing the shift to 15 changes the situation a bit. Now, all the conflicts are resolved immediately after first step, instead of the second step like Shift = 1.
